# Personal Projects
#### A list of all my personal and side projects

* [Chipper](https://github.com/Oluwadamilareolusakin/chipper)
> A social media network for the dauntless, it allows you create a profile, follow users, have followers and share your dauntlessness with the world!

* [199](https://github.com/Oluwadamilareolusakin/members-only)
> A insider's only social media network that allows members post stories about non-members and only members can see who authored the post.

* [Word Station](https://github.com/Oluwadamilareolusakin/word-station)
> A personal journal application that lets you jot down your important thoughts and stories. Sign up and write whatever you want to!

* [Tech Gist](https://github.com/Oluwadamilareolusakin/tech-gist)
> A tech news hub built with the help of Hackernews' API, it allows users browse the top stories in tech as well as read comments on these stories.

* [Sphinx](https://github.com/Oluwadamilareolusakin/sphinx)
> A CSS grid based framework you will absolutely love. I build it to accomodate for even the largest of screen sizes which is something you don't typically find. I am constantly working on it and improving it, so feedback is very much welcome!

* [Newsweek](https://github.com/Oluwadamilareolusakin/news-week-replica)
